![PicoSOC implemented on an FPGA with a hard PicoRV32 Core](/assets/images/picosoc.PNG){: .align-left .fixwidth--4}
## Bring Your Own IPs into the Heterogeneous Architecture

This custom FPGA has an embedded hard
[PicoRV32](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32) core (the large orange
block in the middle), in addition to two types of CLBs (light and dark purple
blocks), and some BRAM blocks (narrow cyan blocks).
This figures shows the
[picosoc](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32/tree/master/picosoc)
design implemented on this custom FPGA.

* Figure generated by VTR
* **TODO**: Add a README for this example in GitHub
