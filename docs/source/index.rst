Welcome to Princeton Reconfigurable Gate Array's documentation!
===============================================================

Princeton Reconfigurable Gate Array (PRGA) is a customizable, scalable,
versatile, extensible open-source framework for building and using custom
FPGAs.

Features
--------
* Highly customizable FPGA structures: bring your own IP cores, design your
  multi-modal primitive cells into PRGA, and explore heterogeneous CLB/IOB,
  custom routing connectivity, and more!
* Scalability: capable of imitating commercial-class FPGAs
* Extensibility: modularized workflow and well-documented low-level API
* Versatility: supporting different configuration circuitry types
